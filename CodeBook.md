This data set contains data of means and standard deviations from the **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset**. The data in the original dataset is from accelerometer
and gyroscope data captured at 50 Hz and filtered with a low band pass. The acceleration signal is split into body and gravity signals then further filtered with a low pass filter at 0.3 Hz.

For futher information look at the  `features_info.txt` of the original data set.

To be more speciic, features that contained `mean()` or `std()` were extracted from the original dataset.
